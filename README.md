File Upload and Download Server-Client Application
This project implements a simple file upload and download server-client application using Python's socket library. The server listens for connections from clients and allows them to upload files to a specific directory on the server or download files from the server's directory to the client's machine.

Features
File Upload: Clients can upload files to a predefined directory on the server.
File Download: Clients can download files from the server's directory to their local Downloads folder.
Directory Management: The server ensures the existence of the required directory and handles file operations securely.
Error Handling: The server handles various errors, such as permission issues and missing files, gracefully.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for both the server and client.
Socket Programming: Utilized for creating the communication channel between the server and clients.
File Management: Using Python's os and shutil libraries for file operations.
Setup and Usage
Server
Setup:

Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Save the server code to a file named server.py.
Run the Server:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
The server will start listening on 127.0.0.1:65432.

Client
Setup:

Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Save the client code to a file named client.py.
Run the Client:

bash
Copy code
python client.py
Follow the prompts to either upload or download a file.
Example Usage
Upload a File:

When prompted, enter upload.
Provide the full path of the file you wish to upload.
The server will save the file to the predefined directory and confirm the upload.
Download a File:

When prompted, enter download.
Provide the name of the file you wish to download.
The server will copy the file to the client's Downloads folder and confirm the download.
Project Structure


server.py: Contains the server-side code for handling client connections and managing file uploads and downloads.
client.py: Contains the client-side code for interacting with the server to upload or download files.
Detailed Code Explanation
Server (server.py)
Socket Setup: Initializes the server socket to listen on 127.0.0.1:65432.
Client Handling: Accepts client connections and processes their requests.
File Operations:
Upload: Receives a file path from the client and copies the file to the server's directory.
Download: Sends the requested file from the server's directory to the client's Downloads folder.
Error Handling: Manages various exceptions and errors, ensuring the server runs smoothly.
Client (client.py)
User Interaction: Prompts the user to choose between uploading or downloading a file.
Server Communication: Connects to the server and sends the user's request.
File Operations:
Upload: Sends the file path to the server for uploading.
Download: Sends the file name to the server for downloading.
